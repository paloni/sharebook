# sharebook
Share your book with a friend, church/library member and don't forget about it!

This project will help small libraries at churches, home schools, and individuals. 

In order to take a book from the library, you will need to scan a QR-code or ISBN-code. If a person is a friend or a member he will be able to take a book. At the same time, the owner of the book will be notified about the event and remind after a specified amount of days. For now, users will be able to search for books in 2 locations: Google Books and IsbnDB (largest books collection). There will be a small fee because of the paid subscription with IsbnDB.

In the future, I would like to add the possibility to find friends by topics of the books they read or just by books they have in their collection.

The plan is to make WebApi and on top of it makes Android, Web, and Desktop versions.
I use .NET CORE 5 for API (REST), planning to use Xamarin (for mobile) and Angular (web).

If you would like to contribute to the project, please let me know!
